        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>6. SECURITY</strong></p>

        <p style="margin-left:0.21in">We have put in place procedures in an effort to safeguard and help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect. We also take reasonable steps to help make sure that third parties we work with protect the security of your Personal Data.</p>

        <p style="margin-left:0.21in">Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share the password with anyone.</p>

        <p style="margin-left:0.21in">However, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Site, and any transmission is at your own risk and it is possible that third parties may unlawfully access such personal information through a number of means despite our efforts.</p>

        <p><strong>9. YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p>

        <p style="margin-left:0.21in">You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for marketing purposes.

We will promptly delete your account and you will no longer receive information or updates regarding the Service.
